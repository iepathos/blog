Here is a screenshot of the UI presented to you by Amazon Video on a Playstation 4.

You can see at the bottom of the screen, the L1 button for removing items from the list is placed on the right hand side of the screen and the R1 button for Adding Season to Watchlist is on the left hand side of the screen.  The circle button which is also the far right on the controller is on the far left of the screen.  This is the exact opposite of how it should be setup.  It's almost as if someone held up a mirror and then designed a great UI for the mirror image instead of the actual screen.  This is a good example of poor UI design.  When laying out control information on the screen, it is best to try to coordinate the orientation on the screen with whatever input is expected i.e. R is for right and L is for Left.  Amazon video is still trying to catch up with Netflix in a lot of ways, UI just being one example, but they are making steady progress so this will hopefully get fixed within a few months.

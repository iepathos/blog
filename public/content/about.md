I'm a freelance web developer and dev ops engineer.  I spend most of my time hacking away at applications in Python and Javascript.  I got into computer programming because I found myself thinking a lot about the possiblities for applications out there.  When I thought about all of the things I could build within a decade of devoting myself to programming, I knew it was the path for me.  I have about 5 years of professional programming experience and consider my programming skill to be mid-level.  For the last year, I've been the senior Python developer and dev ops engineer for [endvest.com](https://endvest.com).  I'm a fast learner and I'm good at finding solutions for bugs in the stack and server deployments.  I strive to be clear in my communications with clients and co-workers to minimize any misunderstandings.  I've led international teams of programmers from India, the Dominican Republic, Poland, and Armenia developing a variety of web applications over the past two years.
